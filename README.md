# kshAnalysis
Objective: Using the website of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) (https://ksh.hu), select a topic of interest. Download the chosen statistical data in CSV or Excel format from the KSH website. Develop a Python program tasked with generating statistics, line charts, and scatter plots based on the imported data. Additionally, perform linear regression on the scatter plot data. As part of the project, analyze and evaluate the findings.

Implementation: I selected the topic "Number of Residential Property Transactions Among Private Individuals." I implemented each of the points listed above and organized the code into object-oriented .py files. Additionally, for simplicity, the program was equipped with a GUI interface. Using the "Analyze" button, various statistical data can be printed to the console. The "Save" button allows us to save this data, as well as the raw data in a structured format, for later use if needed. The "Charts" button generates the aforementioned diagrams (line chart, scatter plot, etc.) for us.
